# Cluster-and-Classification-Analysis-Using-Python\

**Task 1: Machine Learning - Clustering**
Task: Use any clustering technique to extract patterns or segregate data into groups.
User Story: User should be able to provide a data point (a row) and program should be able to identify
to which cluster given data point belongs to and why?

**Task 2: Machine Learning - Classification**
Task: Train any classification model(s) on the train sheet and test your algorithm on the test sheet.

**Task 3: Python**
Task: Use rawdata as input and derive
1. Datewise total duration for each inside and outside.
2. Datewise number of picking and placing activity done.
